# WM_VoiceAssistant

Embark on a journey with me into the realm of voice-activated smart home interaction. 
WM_VoiceAssistant is my endeavor into sculpting a voice assistant with Python, a fresh language on my coding palette. With an eye on the horizon, I envision it evolving into a multilingual aide capable of seamless integration with my smart home setup, making everyday living a breezy experience.


Current Capabilities:
•	Multilingual interaction: English, Ukrainian, or Russian.
•	Speech-to-Text (STT) via PyAudio and Vosk libraries.
•	Text-to-Speech (TTS) using the pyttsx3 library and RHVoice for Ukrainian and Russian speech models.
•	Home Assistant integration through Long-Lived Access Tokens, unlocking control and monitoring of smart home devices and entities.
•	ChatGPT integration for tackling unknown queries with a finesse.
•	All features, barring ChatGPT, are designed to function locally without relying on external APIs.


Upcoming Adventures:
•	Crafting a custom TTS language model.
•	Enriching the command set for everyday interactions.
•	Refining Home Assistant integration for broader compatibility and ease of command recognition.
•	Smart speaker integration.
•	Developing an animated avatar in sync with voice interactions.
•	Merging the animated avatar into a VR environment.
•	Exploring holography for a captivating avatar display.
•	Bridging the Voice Assistant with a mini home robot for an enriched user experience.
